# Combine-Clips
A python3 script takes all clips in a directory and adds them to a txt file. It then combines the clips into one video called output

To use place all clips and this python file in the SAME directory/folder. The output file will also be in this folder when the script is completed
Feel free to edit this as needed for example to use a different video file type
